          <p>
            <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is a tool for installing scripts in <strong>RPGMaker VXAce</strong>.
            It makes dependency management easier. On top of the comfort it provides, <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>
            is free software, licensed under <strong>LGPL</strong>.<br />
            <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> synchronizes via internet with the latest versions of scripts
            in order to guarantee that they are always up-to-date (and cover all known bugs)!
          </p>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The idea behind <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is to allow script users to easily and quickly
            install scripts. Indeed, <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is a tiny executable that permits the
            adding of scripts to one or several projects. Here is an example of a typical method of
            using <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>Select a project</li>
              <li>Add (with commands) the script list for the project</li>
              <li>Start the project building routine</li>
              <li>Start working!</li>
            </ul>
            It's also possible to update scripts and, obviously, any script writer can add to the database
            of available scripts (we hope they do)!
          </p>
          <h3>Downloading</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> can be obtained really easily, just go to the
            <a href="https://github.com/RMEx/RMEBuilder/releases/latest">Releases</a> page
            and download the file <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder.zip</code>.
          </p>

          <h3>Installing</h3>
          <p class="alert">
            In order for <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> to work perfectly, configuring your antivirus/firewall
            is sometimes necessary so that it lets <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> download files.
          </p>
          <p>
            Installing <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is very straightforward, just unzip
            <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder.zip</code> in the chosen folder (not necessarily
            inside an RPGMaker project folder, you can use <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> to build
            several projects at once).
          </p>

          <h2>Normal use</h2>

          <h3>First launch</h3>
          <p>
            To launch <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>, you simply need to click on
            <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder.bat</code> (which is a shortcut to launch the application).
            Upon starting for the first time, the application will ask you to choose the target project.
            Choosing a valid RPGMaker VXAce project is mandatory.<br />
            Once the application knows the target project, a command line device can be accessed.
            With it, you can enter commands relating to project building.
          </p>
          <p class="alert">
            You can change your target project at any time by entering the <code class="inline-code">target</code>
            command, which, on top of giving you the current target project path, allows you to change it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example of <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>'s first launch.
          </p>
          <a class="image" href="images/1.gif"><img src="images/1.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <h3>Composition of a schema</h3>
          <p>
            After a project has been chosen in the application, you can now add to it any scripts you want.
            To do so, you can use the <code class="inline-code">show</code> command which displays the list
            of available packages on the internet.
            <br />
            The <code class="inline-code">about package-name</code> returns information (description, authors,
            etc.) about a package.
          </p>
          <a class="image" href="images/2.gif"><img src="images/2.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <p>
            In order to add packages to a project, simply use the
            <code class="inline-code">add package-name</code> command. This command's effect is to add
            a package to the list of packages to be added to the project.<br />
            The <code class="inline-code">schema</code> command displays the list of packages to be installed.
          </p>

          <a class="image" href="images/3.gif"><img src="images/3.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <p class="alert">
            It is obvious that if <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is closed, all scripts in the
            schema will be saved and will still be there when you reopen it!
          </p>

          <h4>Modifying the schema</h4>
          <p>
            By default, during the compilation step (which we will see later), 
            scripts are installed in the order in which they were added. Obviously, you can change the order:
            <ul>
              <li><code class="inline-code">remove package-name</code>: removes the package from the list</li>
              <li><code class="inline-code">move package-name up</code>: moves the package up one place</li>
              <li><code class="inline-code">move package-name down</code>: moves the package down one place</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <a class="image" href="images/4.gif"><img src="images/4.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <p class="alert">
            Haha I made a typo in the <strong>gif</strong> (mouwe instead of mouse, aha) :D sorry!
          </p>

          <h3>Compiling the project</h3>
          <p>Once your schema is complete, you can compile your project.
          Compiling in <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> consists in downloading the scripts currently in the schema
          and assembling them in the <code class="inline-code">Scripts.rvdata2</code> file.</p>

          <p class="alert">
            Be aware that, before compiling your project, it is mandatory that you close it in RPGMaker. 
            You will be able to open it back later, once the compilation is done.
          </p>

          <a class="image" href="images/5.gif"><img src="images/5.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <p>
            When the <code class="inline-code">build</code> command is used, the application will download all
            unknown scripts, and will then make a <code class="inline-code">Scripts.rvdata2</code> file, which it
            will merge with the other scripts. 
            This means your project can have pre-installed scripts without problem. <br />
            Each time the <code class="inline-code">build</code> command is called, elements built by
            <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> are purged. Thus, if you decide to remove an element from your schema
            after compiling (with the <code class="inline-code">remove</code> command), then it will be taken
            into account upon recompiling (<code class="inline-code">build</code>).
          </p>

          <h4>Managing assets</h4>
          <p>When compiling your project, <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> sometimes will ask you if you want
          to merge assets. It happens when packages contain external files (images or DLLs for example).
          Upon first compiling the project with a script that requires assets, it is recommended to answer
          Yes (Y). However, after the script has been added once, you do not need to merge its assets again.
          If you edit the images, merging the assets again will override all your edits, it would be bad!</p>

          <p class="alert">
            At any time, you can fetch a package's assets with the
            <code class="inline-code">get assets of package-name</code> command.
          </p>

          <h4>Updating packages</h4>
          <p>
            Upon launch, <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> will check if updates for your installed scripts exist.
            It's very useful for keeping up-to-date with script versions and edits:
          </p>
          <a class="image" href="images/6.gif"><img src="images/6.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <p>
            You can also use the <code class="inline-code">check updates</code> command,
            which will check if packages are up-to-date.
          </p>

          <p class="alert">
            Once a package is updated, running the <code class="inline-code">build</code> command
            (after closing the RPGMaker project) is mandatory in order to take the update into account!
          </p>

          <h4>Dependency management</h4>
          <p>If a package depends on another package, it's not necessary to reference the latter in the schema.
          When building the project (with the use of the <code class="inline-code">build</code> or <code class="inline-code">build dev</code>
          commands), the application will download and install all dependencies. If a package with dependencies is removed from the schema,
          the dependencies will be removed as well (unless they were explicitly added (with <code class="inline-code">add</code>) to the schema).</p>

          <h3>Temporary compilation</h3>
          <p>The problem with <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is that you have to close it after every edit.
          In order to address this, it is possible to compile temporarily. Using the <code class="inline-code">build dev</code>
          command will make a temporary file that, when the project is launched, will read the scripts from where they were downloaded.
          This allows you to only use <code class="inline-code">build dev</code> (and so, close the RPGMaker project) when
          <strong>adding</strong> or <strong>removing</strong> a file in the schema.
          Package updates don't force a project rebuild. It's very convenient for oft-updated scripts.
          <br />
          However, before distributing your project, executing a <code class="inline-code">build</code> is mandatory so that your project does not
          rely on temporary files anymore!</p>

          <h3>Updating RMEBuilder</h3>
          <p>
            When an update for <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is available, the application will warn you.
            You simply need to confirm it and it will update itself.
          </p>

          <a class="image" href="images/maj.gif"><img src="images/maj.gif" alt="launch RME!"/>
          Zoom in!</a>

          <h3>Before publishing your project</h3>
          <p>
            Once your project is complete, you can remove the <code class="inline-code">build_schema.rb</code>
            file from the project folder (don't forget to <code class="inline-code">build</code>, in order to
            make sure all your scripts are installed). Now all that's left is to encrypt (or not) your project
            and diffuse it!
          </p>

          <h2>For script writers</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> is obviously not destined to be used to publish and store only
            <strong>our</strong> scripts. We hope that it will be used by a lot of people to easily share
            scripts throughout the world! (starry eyes)
          </p>

          <h3>Make a script available in RMEBuilder</h3>
          <h4>Publishing medium</h4>
          <p>
            In order for a script to be available in <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>, it is important to understand
            that it must be available on the internet. For that, we personally use <a href="https://www.github.com">Github</a>,
            which allows us to manage versions of our scripts. You can also use Dropbox, but Github is really suited for the job!
          </p>
          <h4>Packages</h4>
          <p>
            In order for a script to be fully compatible with <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>,
            its structure must be described in a file that will always be named <code class="inline-code">package.rb</code>.
          </p>
          <h4>Example with a simple package</h4>
          <p>
            The package used in this example is <code class="inline-code">nuki-break-scene</code>,
            which allows users to easily create pause systems.
            <a href="https://github.com/nukiFW/RPGMaker/tree/master/break-scene">Its Github folder can be found here</a>.
            <br />
            The package's structure is simple enough: <code class="inline-code">script.rb</code> is the script (elementary!)
            and <code class="inline-code">package.rb</code> describes the package:
<pre><code class="ruby"># Package description
  Package.new(
  	name: 'nuki-break-scene',
  	version: vsn(1, 0, 0),
  	authors: {'Nuki' => 'xaviervdw@gmail.com'},
  	components: ['script.rb'],
  	description: 'Provide a little customizable scene for InGame\'s pause',
  )
</code></pre>
	    As you can see, you simply need to instantiate a <code class="inline-code">Package</code> object.
	    This is the minimum required for a package.
            <ul>
              <li><code class="inline-code">name</code>: name of the package</li>
              <li><code class="inline-code">version</code>: version number (updates can work thanks to this argument)</li>
              <li><code class="inline-code">authors</code>: a hash with the authors as keys and their email addresses as values</li>
              <li><code class="inline-code">components</code>: an ordered list of the script files. Their path is relative to the <code class="inline-code">package.rb</code> file</li>
              <li><code class="inline-code">description</code>: a little description for the package</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>Example with several files</h4>
          <p>
            This time we are going to use <a href="https://github.com/RMEx/RME/tree/master/src">the RMD package</a> as an example.
            As you can see, there is not a lot of changes, except that there are several authors and several files:
<pre><code class="ruby"># Package description
Package.new(
  name: 'RME',
  version: vsn(0, 0, 5),
  authors: {
    'Nuki' => 'xaviervdw@gmail.com',
    'Grim' => 'grimfw@gmail.com',
    'Raho' => '',
    'Joke' => 'joke@biloucorp.com',
    'Mspawn' => ''
  },
  components: [
    'SDK.rb',
    'SDK.Gui.rb',
    'Database.rb',
    'Internal.rb',
    'EvEx.rb',
    'Commands.rb',
    'Incubator.rb',
    'EE4Cmds.rb',
    'Tools.rb',
    'DocGenerator.rb',
    'Doc.rb'
  ],
  description: 'RME is a powerful tool to improve your RPGMaker VXAce experience!'
)
</code></pre>
          </p>
          <h4>Example with dependencies</h4>
          <p>
            The <code class="inline-code">DisplayText</code> script
            (<a href="https://github.com/nukiFW/RPGMaker/tree/master/DisplayText">which can be found here</a>)
            requires installing the <code class="inline-code">StandardizeRGSS</code> script beforehand.
            You simply need to specify it in a <code class="inline-code">dependancies</code> argument, which
            takes a list of scripts on which the current script depends:
<pre><code># Package description
Package.new(
  name: 'display-text',
  version: vsn(1, 0, 0),
  authors: {'Nuki' => 'xaviervdw@gmail.com'},
  components: ['script.rb'],
  description: 'Provide a full customisable text engine',
  dependancies: ["standardize-rgss"]
)</code></pre>
That's it, you know enough to start correctly packaging your scripts!
          </p>

          <h4>Example with assets</h4>
          <p>
            It may be that a script contains additional files: assets. For example, a DLL or images.
            To include them you simply need to add an <code class="inline-code">assets</code> parameter, which is
            a <strong>Hash</strong> whose keys are resource URLs (relative or not) and values are their positions in the project.
            For example, here is <a href="https://github.com/hyperaho/RPGMaker/tree/master/useless">the "raho-useless" package file</a>
            which doesn't have any use except demonstrating how assets work:


<pre><code># Package description
Package.new(
	name: 'raho-useless',
	version: vsn(1, 0, 0),
	authors: {'Hyperaho' => ''},
	components: ['script.rb'],
	assets: {
		'assets/raho1.png' => 'Graphics/Pictures/raho1.png',
		'http://full.ouplo.com/f/12/AgkA.png' => 'Graphics/Pictures/raho2.png'
	},
	description: 'Epic script for Epic projects'
)
</code></pre>

            This package uses two images: one with a relative paht and the other with an absolute path.
          </p>

          <p class="alert">
            Beware! Don't forget that <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>'s goal is to be used by lots of people,
            so consider prefixing your assets in order to avoid collisions!
            For example, if I publish a menu that uses an image, I should name the image
            <code class="inline-code">nuki-menu-my-image.png</code> in order to guarantee that it does not
            override (and that it is not overriden by) any other image.
          </p>

          <h4>Submit a package as an RMEBuilder patch</h4>
          <p>
            The package list is a Github respository. To contribute, you simply need to "<strong>fork</strong>"
            <a href="https://github.com/RMEx/RMEPackages">this project</a>.
            To add a package, just edit the list of available packages in the <code class="inline-code">packages.rb</code> file,
            and add a relation as such: <code class="inline-code">"package name" => "URL of the corresponding package.rb"</code>.
          </p>

          <p class="alert">
            Be careful that the URL must point to a raw file, not to an HTML page.
            For Github you have to use the <strong>raw</strong> link so that only the file contents
            are exported, and not the entire HTML page.
          </p>

          <h4>About package naming semantics</h4></h4>
          <p>
            There aren't any formally stated semantics. However, in order to avoid package collisions,
            we suggest that you prefix your package names with the author's nickname.
            If the package is major and/or renowned, it is possible not to prefix it. However, we reserve the right to reject
            a package list edit if a package would override another.
          </p>
          <h3>The customPackages folder</h3>
          <p>
            In the <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder/customPackages</code> folder, you can add your in-progress
            scripts. It allows for reading packages without them being hosted. This means you can make folders
            for your WIPs in there and work on them as if they were already published.
            This prevents you from having to publish an unfinished script. <br />
            Moreover, thanks to the <code class="inline-code">build dev</code> compilation command, you can also
            edit your code from your favorite editor (like emacs), without having to constantly copy-paste after every minor edit.
          </p>
          <h4>Cloning existing packages</h4>
          <p>
            For whatever reason, you might want to edit a package already published by someone else.
            In <strong>RMEBuilder</strong> you can use the <code class="inline-code">clone package-name</code> command
            and the package will be copied into your <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder/customPackages</code> folder.
            A package in <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder/customPackages</code> will always be added at the expense
            of an external package in the building step, so if you want to revert to the original package, you will
            have to remove it from <code class="inline-code">RMEBuilder/customPackages</code> or use the
            <code class="inline-code">reclone package-name</code> command to override the local copy with the latest
            published version.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
          That's it with the <strong>RMEBuilder</strong>, presentation tour, we hope that it will be really useful
          and that it will change (and simplify) users' ways of installing scripts. We also hope that script writers
          won't hesitate in publishing their scripts! The more the merrier :D
          <br /><strong>GOODBYE</strong>.</p>
